\section{Introduction}

Paragraph one: Provide context to the work.
What is the task? What is the state of the task?

Paragraph two: What is the problem in this context? What is the situation that you are trying to correct or overcome?

Paragraph three: What is the proposed solution at a high level? What is the result of the method, and how does it impact the problem?

Paragraph four: Justify why this approach is worthwhile. What is the point in trying to learn to classify split or merge edges specifically? Why don't we just try and make the initial segmentation better?

Paragraph five: Optimistically, what is the consequence of the method - what can I do now that I could not do before?
