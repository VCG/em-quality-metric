\section{Related Work}

Paragraph: Work on segmentation in Connectomics...but none of these address specifically learning real edges against edges which lead to split or merge errors.

Arganda-Carreras et al.~\cite{10.3389/fnana.2015.00142} posed the ISBI 2D EM segmentation challenge, where a 30-image corpus of cell `in/out' labels was used to train boundary detection. To overcome the often small amounts of expert-labeled ground-truth segmentation data for training convolutional networks for biomedical tasks, Ronneberger et al.~\cite{RonnebergerFB15} use a contracting/expanding path architecture to enable precise localization.
