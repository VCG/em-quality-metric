\section{Method}

Paragraph one: Overview of the method. What are the high level steps taken to build the system? What are the key techniques used within the system?

\subsection{Labelled Data - Generating fake splits and merges}

Paragraph: What is the goal of generating labeled data? How do you generate fake splits? How do you generate fake merges? How do you generate patches for training? How can we know that the training data is representative of real data?

\caption{Show visually each of the inputs to the system on a couple of patches.}
\end{figure}

Using only one binary mask allows us to look at merge errors over more than two regions.


\subsection{Network Design}

Paragraph: What is the rationale behind our network design? Why do we think this will work over other approaches? 

Paragraph: What are the inputs to the design? What is the design? Parameters of the design.

If we have enough space it would be good to have a figure of the network architecture, because we have these 
parallel sub nets that only feed into the mlp together at the very end.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Training}

Paragraph: How did we train the network? What tricks did we employ (e.g., rotation)? What are the parameters of the training? What software stack did we use? Hardware platform, training time (none very interesting, but for completeness). When do we stop training?

Paragraph: What are the thresholds in the system? How do we pick the thresholds?
