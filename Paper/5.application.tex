\section{Application - Proof reading}

Paragraph: Description of the interactive process of proof reading.

Paragraph: How would this be improved for splits? 1. Automatic fixes, but give user control over the threshold so that they can judge it correctly. 2. Providing an ordered list of edges to inspect.

Paragraph: How would the proof-reading process be improved for merges?

\begin{figure}
\missingfigure{System of notification within Dojo, for instance.}
\caption{What would it look like if we integrated this into Dojo? E.G., set threshold for automatic edits, with visual marks to notify automatic edits. Then, ordered list of most probable edges that the proof-reader should look through.}
\end{figure}

The hard part is detecting whether there is a merge error at all; not the part that picks the edge which corrects the merge error.
