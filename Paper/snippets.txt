  \caption{a) Our proposed network architecture with up to four input channels. Each input channel involves two convolutional and two pooling layers, where the first is a dynamic pooling layer inspired by Bogovic et al.~\cite{BogovicHJ13}. b) We trained five different network configurations with three and four inputs: A) image, boundary map probability, and merged binary mask, B) extended with a small border mask, C) extended with a large border mask and D)+E) using a single label binary mask instead of the merged one with the small and large border mask.}
